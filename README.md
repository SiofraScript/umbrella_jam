# Umbrella Jam
Doremy is on a quest to curb the number of vengeful spirits being born from the torment of abandoned umbrellas. She recruits Kogasa and sends her into the dreams
of the anguished umbrellas. Unfortunately for Kogasa, the dreams are closer to nightmares and the mission isn't as straight-forward as it seems.
